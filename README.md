# PlainSQL

PlainSQL uses AI (Gemini) to let users use natural language to speak with a database so they do not have to write SQL queries at all!

The backend code connects to the database engine and get the database schemas (its tables, its columns and data types) so the AI knows its structure and gets more context. Then user will input and AI turns that input into a SQL statement and the code will execute that query and returns the data to the user as a UI on the frontend.
